This was a commissioned work from a friend of mine, where he needed a front-end-only design for a website that farmers will use to directly sell their products to consumers.

## Dev notes
Built with a couple of days a lot of simple mistakes that could have probably been easily resolved. Great practice for me to use tailwind css. I had a lot of difficulty producing this because of my difficulty in choosing the colors that they asked me to use but it ended up helping me improve in using colors. Looking back at it, kinda looks funny with the color combination.

## Built with
React JS Front-end
Tailwind CSS for designing
